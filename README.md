We have developed a system designed to manage parking lot tracking. 
The system includes a parking lot manager, who maintains a linked list of all parking facilities. 
Each parking lot contains an array of customers and parking spaces. 
Any parking space can be occupied by any customer by indicating the vehicle that has taken the spot. 
Each customer has an array of vehicles, payments, and a parking subscription (which provides a discount if active).

When the program is executed, in the main menu, one can manage the parking lot system. 
Upon selecting a parking lot (by ID), an additional menu opens where one can add and remove customers from the parking lot, occupy or vacate a parking space, add a parking space to the parking lot, and other detailed actions are explained further in the Project report.
